# go-http-echo

A simple golang HTTP server to echo requests

## How to use

    go run echo.go

This will start the HTTP server running on localhost, port 8080. 
To run on a different port, set the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable before running.

Once running, you can make requests from a browser (or any HTTP client) via `http://localhost:8080/`
